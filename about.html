            <h2 class="about-me-title">About Me</h2>
            <p class="about-paragraph">My path to homeland security began not in a classroom, but through lived experience across continents. Growing up between the UAE, Pakistan, and the United States, I witnessed firsthand how different nations approach security from strict enforcement to more moderate frameworks—and, more importantly, how these policies shape daily life. I saw how security measures influence the way people think, move through their communities, and balance freedom with safety. These experiences taught me that homeland security isn't just about policies on paper...it's about understanding the human impact of every decision.</p>
            
            <p class="about-paragraph">My academic background reflects this multifaceted perspective. Psychology taught me to understand human behavior and motivations like the "why" behind actions that often determines whether a security measure succeeds or fails. My training in paramedic sciences instilled the ability to make critical decisions under pressure, a skill essential when analyzing time-sensitive intelligence. Even my passion for creative writing plays a role, helping me communicate complex security concepts clearly and think through scenarios from multiple angles. Together, these disciplines shape how I approach homeland security: not as isolated systems, but as interconnected challenges requiring both analytical rigor and human understanding.</p>
            
            <p class="about-paragraph">What excites me most about this field is the puzzle of maintaining national integrity while crafting policies that genuinely protect citizens. It's a delicate balance where too much security can erode the freedoms we're trying to protect, while too little leaves vulnerabilities exposed. I'm drawn to the challenge of finding that equilibrium, where effective security measures coexist with civil liberties. My international perspective gives me a unique lens: I've seen what works, what doesn't, and how cultural context shapes security effectiveness. Whether it's analyzing policy gaps, assessing threats, or understanding how communities respond to security measures, I bring a global viewpoint grounded in real-world observation.</p>
            
            <p class="about-paragraph">When I'm not studying, you'll find me following current events, analyzing case studies, or exploring how different regions approach shared security challenges. My travels include time in Iraq and across multiple countries that continue to inform my understanding of risk, resilience, and the human dimension of homeland security. I believe the best intelligence analysts aren't just data processors; they're people who understand that behind every threat assessment is a complex web of human motivations, cultural contexts, and policy consequences.</p>

            <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in research, you'll find me exploring arts and crafts which is a creative outlet that reminds me that problem-solving takes many forms. Whether it's working with my hands or analyzing security frameworks, I believe that diverse experiences enrich academic work and provide fresh perspectives on complex problems.</p>
            <p>I'm always interested in collaborating with fellow researchers, discussing new ideas, and exploring opportunities that can advance our collective understanding of homeland security and intelligence analysis.</p>
