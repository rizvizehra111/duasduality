            <p class="about-paragraph">I am currently pursuing my degree in Homeland Security from University of Maryland Global Campus with a focus on intelligence analysis. What draws me to this field is the puzzle-solving aspect. I love breaking down complex situations, understanding the motivations behind events, and connecting dots that others might miss.</p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">When I am not studying, you will often find me reading about current events, analyzing case studies, or diving into policy papers. I am particularly fascinated by how intelligence failures happen and what we can learn from them. There is something compelling about understanding not just what happened, but why it happened and how it could have been prevented.</p>
