            <p class="hero-subtitle">Homeland Security Student • Intelligence Analyst • Critical Thinker</p>
            <p class="hero-description">Welcome! This space is where I share my research, ideas, and reflections on homeland security and intelligence. I have always been curious about national security events such as what drives them, how decisions are made, and how they can be prevented. I enjoy digging into policy and thinking critically about how small changes can make a big difference. What interests me most is how the various sectors of homeland security come together to protect people and ensure safety not just on a national but global scale.</p>
